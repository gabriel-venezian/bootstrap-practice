        <h4 class="white" id="item-1">Uchiha Itachi</h4>
        <h5 class="white" id="item-1-1">About</h5>
        <p class="white">
          Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, <i>Uchiha Itachi</i>) was a ninja of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan that served as an
          Anbu Captain.
          He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger
          brother, Sasuke.
          He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought
          him
          into frequent
          conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke — who sought to avenge their clan by killing
          Itachi.
          Following his death,
          Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only
          ever
          in the interest of his
          brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.
          A pacifist at heart, Itachi did not actually like fighting and would avoid it when he could. When he couldn't,
          he would end the fight
          as quickly as possible, all the while holding himself back as much as possible. Despite this, Itachi felt his
          own needs were secondary
          to the greater good's and to that end he became a shinobi. He trained tirelessly to improve himself as quickly
          as he could and subjected
          himself to all of the shinobi life's inconveniences without complaint for the simple motivation of being
          useful to others. His commitment
          borderlined recklessness, due to training privately using extremely deadly methods such as dodging a barrage
          of kunai

        </p>
        <h5 class="white" id="item-1-2">Personality</h5>
        <p class="white">
          From a young age, Itachi was calm and insightful, showing noticeable maturity for his age and knowledge
          on
          how to deal with every
          situation. For all his accomplishments, talent, and fame, Itachi was a rather humble man. Never arrogant
          about his own abilities nor
          underestimating others, most things he said would be unbiased and accurate. If an opponent exceeded his
          expectations or posed a
          legitimate challenge to him or his allies, Itachi would freely admit it. As a seven-year-old, his
          reasoning
          was on par with a Hokage.
          Having studied history, not just of his clan or his village but of the world, he gained a broader
          appreciation of what was important.
          Learning so much enabled him to understand how events of the past came to happen and, when he applied
          that
          same understanding into the
          future, he became concerned for where things were going. At the same time, Itachi was still fairly
          naïve
          as a child in many
          real-world scenarios and as such was willing to learn from his peers on how to differentiate situations.
          He
          lived at a distance,
          observing individuals and ideas without getting directly involved so that he could fully understand
          them..
        </p>
        <h5 class="white" id="item-1-3">Powers</h5>
        <p class="white">
          Even within the famed and battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi was a genius of such talent,
          consistently showing prowess well-beyond his years, effortlessly learning new techniques
          from simple observation, and rising rapidly through the ninja ranks. His prowess rivalled
          Shisui Uchiha, who was well-regarded as the strongest Uchiha of their time. He was highly
          proficient in all three main ninja skill sets and gained praise from allies and foes alike;
          Orochimaru, one of the Sannin, openly admitted Itachi was stronger than he was. Obito revealed
          that despite having an unknown illness and Sasuke having absorbed Orochimaru's power, Itachi
          could have killed Sasuke during their battle if he wanted to. Even when restrained in this way,
          a team of jōnin were still pushed to their limits against Itachi.
          As an Uchiha, Itachi's chakra was naturally strong, but his actual reserves were greatly diminished due to his
          terminal illness.
          Under normal circumstances, just three uses of his Mangekyō Sharingan in a single day made him unable to use
          his Sharingan and he
          would require significant bed rest afterwards to regain his strength. This prevented him from participating in
          prolonged battles and
          limited his usage of powerful techniques a day before needing significant rest. Itachi had very refined chakra
          control, however,
          which compensated for this, even able to perform his techniques with one-handed seals.

        <h4 class="white" id="item-2">Hatake Kakashi</h4>
        <h5 class="white" id="item-2-1">About</h5>
        <p class="white">
          Kakashi Hatake (はたけカカシ, <i>Hatake Kakashi</i>) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. Famed as Kakashi
          of the Sharingan
          (写輪眼のカカシ, <i>Sharingan no Kakashi</i>), he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja; regularly looked to for
          advice and leadership
          despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on Team 7, Kakashi teaches the importance of
          teamwork, a lesson he
          received, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World
          War, Kakashi becomes
          Konoha's Sixth Hokage (六代目火影, <i>Rokudaime Hokage</i>, Literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).
        </p>
        <h5 class="white" id="item-2-2">Personality</h5>
        <p class="white"> Since his early childhood, Kakashi was very independent and self-confident, at times even
          appearing arrogant
          and condescending.
          Despite that, Kakashi was very perceptive and intuitive, quickly realising the situation for what it was.
          After his father's death,
          Kakashi became more stern, aloof and cold toward others, following all the rules to the letter, chastising
          any who disobeyed them and
          being willing to abandon his comrades to finish missions. As an adult, Kakashi typically has a relaxed and
          almost bored attitude, not
          prone to getting too worked up about anything or by anyone. Despite his increasingly growing reputation and
          prowess as a ninja, Kakashi
          has shown no signs of arrogance, and is rather modest about his abilities. He is habitually tardy, showing
          up when it suits him, using
          excuses that convince nobody, and later leaving for equally poor reasons. Though Kakashi wants others to
          believe this is how he always
          acts, he only does so for matters that aren't of particular importance.
        </p>
        <h5 class="white" id="item-2-3">Powers</h5>
        <p class="white">
          Kakashi is a natural prodigy, evidenced by his rapid rise through the ninja ranks. His feats and renown cause
          him to be recognised on sight by foreign ninja like Zabuza Momochi and the Fourth Raikage. Several members of
          Akatsuki
          considered him to be strong; he was deemed by Itachi Uchiha to be a dangerous opponent, fought Kakuzu to a
          standstill
          despite the S-rank ninja's abilities, and was viewed by Pain as a major threat. Kakashi is valued highly for
          his combat
          prowess and leadership skills, to the point that many foresaw his rise to Hokage status years before it
          happened. His prowess
          is so impressive that some believe he could take on an entire country
        </p>

        <h4 class="white" id="item-3">Kurosaki Ichigo</h4>
        <h5 class="white" id="item-3-1">About</h5>
        <p class="white">
          Ichigo Kurosaki (黒崎 一護, <i>Kurosaki Ichigo</i>) is a Human who is also a Substitute Shinigami. Ichigo is the
          son of Isshin and
          Masaki Kurosaki, and older brother of Karin and Yuzu. He is also married to Orihime Inoue and has a son
          named Kazui Kurosaki.
          Ichigo's most distinguishing feature is his spiky orange hair, a trait he has been ridiculed about for years
          on end.
          He is a fairly tall, lean-built young man with peach skin and brown eyes. He likes to wear slim fitting
          clothes. He
          has a tendency to wear shirts patterned with the number 15 because his name is a homonym for the number. Since
          becoming
          a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin. When in his spiritual form,
          Ichigo wears
          the standard Shinigami attire, with the addition of a strap across his chest. Initially, it was a thick brown
          belt to hold
          his Zanpakutō sheath, but it later became a red rosary-like strap after awakening his own Shinigami powers. It
          is shaped
          like a kite with a flat top and bottom. Ichigo's appearance has caused several people, including Jūshirō
          Ukitake, to
          note a similarity to Kaien Shiba, the former lieutenant of the 13th Division. After training in the Dangai,
          Ichigo's hair
          grows considerably, and he is noticeably taller, as stated by his friends. After Ichigo loses his Shinigami
          powers, his appearance
          reverts to the way it was before his Dangai training.
        </p>
        <h5 class="white" id="item-3-2">Personality</h5>
        <p class="white">
          When he was younger, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world, always smiling when he was
          with Masaki and regularly
          holding her hand. Despite crying whenever he lost in a match at the dojo he attended, Ichigo started to smile
          again as soon as he saw
          Masaki when she came to pick him up. At a very young age, Ichigo heard his father saying his name means "to
          protect one thing," which
          instilled in him a desire to protect his mother. When his sisters were born, he began attending a dojo for the
          sake of protecting them.
          Since then, the number of people he wishes to protect has continued to grow, causing Ichigo to risk his life
          to protect both the people
          close to him and complete strangers.
          As a teenager, Ichigo is stubborn, short-tempered, strong-willed, and impulsive. Despite claiming not to care
          about what other people
          think about him, he attempts to maintain a detached and "cool" image. He generally keeps his face set in a
          near-permanent scowl, with
          his eyebrows drawn together. His outspoken, hot-headed demeanor is a trait Ichigo himself has acknowledged,
          and if somebody picks a
          fight with him, he cannot help fighting back. He coldly refers to his teachers as "instructors". He is
          genuinely compassionate and
          empathetic towards others, promising to bring a Plus flowers and a toy plane, or soothing others when they
          become upset.
        </p>
        <h5 class="white" id="item-3-3">Powers</h5>
        <p class="white">
          Keen Intellect: Despite his somewhat punkish attitude, Ichigo is analytical, perceptive, and deductive. In his
          high school, Ichigo's
          grades are almost always near the top, despite his work as a Substitute Shinigami. Aside from that, Ichigo can
          determine the pattern
          of his opponent's battle methods and form a proper counter-strategy to defeat his opponent's attacks.
          Immense Spiritual Power: Ichigo has been noted on several occasions to have tremendously vast levels of
          spiritual energy,
          well beyond most other Shinigami. His spiritual power is noted to be heavy, which surprised Renji Abarai.
          Ichigo constantly gives
          off Reiatsu at the level of a captain. Even when worn-out in battle, he can continue fighting effectively
          while still using Getsuga
          Tenshō or unleashing and maintaining his Bankai. Even at less than half strength, his spiritual energy is
          comparable to a captain-level
          fighter. His energy is strong enough to hold back the Sōkyoku, a halberd with the destructive force equivalent
          to one million Zanpakutō
          combined, using only his Zanpakutō. Even before his Dangai training, he could sense Aizen's increased Reiatsu
          as a result of his Second
          Fusion with the Hōgyoku while fighting Gin from a considerable distance away, despite his father, Urahara, and
          Yoruichi, all former Gotei 13
          Captains, not being able to do so themselves while fighting him directly. His Reiatsu is light-blue in color.
          After his training at the
          Soul King Palace, Ichigo was able to overwhelm four Sternritter simultaneously and then calmly fight on par
          with a Sternritter using
          Quincy: Vollständig using just his Shikai and eventually overpower his foe.

                      <p class="justify">
                        The initial concept of Akatsuki was devised by Black Zetsu as part of its plan to revive its
                        mother, though it pretended the idea
                        came from Madara Uchiha. Akatsuki was originally founded by Yahiko during the Third Shinobi
                        World
                        War alongside his childhood
                        friends, Nagato and Konan. As citizens of Amegakure who had been orphaned by the Second Shinobi
                        World War, the three created Akatsuki
                        as a way to bring peace to their home country, which too often got caught in the crossfire of
                        the
                        Five Great Shinobi Countries' many
                        conflicts. In time, the three were approached by Tobi, who introduced himself as Madara Uchiha.
                        Tobi claimed Nagato was the
                        reincarnation of the Sage of Six Paths and offered to teach him to control the power of his
                        Rinnegan, though Yahiko distrusted him
                        and prompted Nagato to turn down his offer. Nevertheless, Tobi would later claim that it was he
                        who encouraged Yahiko to form Akatsuki,
                        unbeknownst to Konan.
                        Akatsuki's desire for an end to war attracted many fellow ninja to their cause and, in time,
                        word of their exploits began to travel
                        beyond Amegakure's borders. Akatsuki's early fame was owed largely to Yahiko's leadership and
                        his
                        natural charisma, which kept the group
                        united and motivated them to persevere despite the difficulties of their goal. Yahiko, however,
                        viewed himself as merely a facilitator for
                        Nagato, who would ultimately be the actual source of world peace because of his Rinnegan. Ame's
                        leader, Hanzō, also became aware of Akatsuki
                        and perceived them as a threat to his rule, a belief encouraged by Danzō Shimura in the anime.
                        Hanzō approached Akatsuki offering to help them
                        broker peace between Konohagakure, Iwagakure, and Sunagakure. When Yahiko, Nagato, and Konan
                        arrived to meet with him, however, they were
                        ambushed by Hanzō's men and members of Danzō's Root, who took Konan hostage and forced Yahiko to
                        commit suicide in order to save her. Enraged
                        by Yahiko's death, Nagato summoned the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path and used it to slaughter
                        their attackers, though Hanzō himself escaped.
                        In the anime, the other members of Akatsuki were tipped off to Hanzō's plan and attempted to
                        provide backup to Yahiko and the others.
                        Tobi and Zetsu intercepted them and after a long battle, Tobi killed the remaining members of
                        the
                        group.
